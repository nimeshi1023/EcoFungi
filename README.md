💻 Description

The Mushroom Cultivation Management System is an integrated web-based solution designed to manage and automate mushroom cultivating operations efficiently. The system covers key functional areas including batch management, environmental monitoring, sales, inventory, and finance management, providing complete control over the cultivation process.

An IoT-based environment control module is incorporated to monitor and regulate critical factors such as humidity and water levels in real time. Sensors collect environmental data and automatically control watering and humidity systems to maintain optimal growing conditions, improving yield quality and consistency.

The system enables to track cultivation batches from initiation to harvest, manage raw materials and stock levels, record sales transactions, and monitor financial performance. By combining smart automation with data-driven management, the platform reduces manual work, minimizes errors, and supports sustainable and efficient mushroom cultivation.
